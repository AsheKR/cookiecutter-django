## Overview

anyone with access to the repository can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as your default branch.

## Features

## Bots

### TODO Bot

See [its page](https://probot.github.io/apps/todo/) for further configuration. This template sets two variables: autoAssign and exclude, which sets the user resposible for the push to be the assignee of the issue, and ignores the .gitattributes file from issue opening. We suggest keeping this way.

### Welcome Bot

This bot are actually three bots into one. See the central [page](https://probot.github.io/apps/welcome/) for further configuration. There are three variables, each being the message posted by the bot: newIssueWelcomeComment, newPRWelcomeComment, and firstPRMergeComment. You may customize these messages if you wish.
